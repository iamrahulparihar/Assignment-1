I got the user interface for the web from a student of mine, Pat Wilken.

To run:

1. The first time run `npm install`
2. Press ctrl-f5 while your focus is in one of the files that starts with a number and is all lower case.

I have created an application or a shop (Faluda shop) in which a customer can order faluda in three different sizes and 2 different flavors.

Once the customer type anything in the input column the application asks for the size of the faluda which the customer is looking for.
Small size is for $10
Medium size is for $15
Large size is for $20
customer can deecide wether he want a veg or nog-veg faluda
To run the application you need to go to assignment1 and then run it without debug. 
After that you need open any web browser and type localhost3002 and you can start the application.
Then the application will ask for sweets if the customer want. And then the customer will get a receipt for the order with sweet and the time will also be given at which the order will be ready.


There is a brief [presentation here](EventsAndObjects.pdf).
